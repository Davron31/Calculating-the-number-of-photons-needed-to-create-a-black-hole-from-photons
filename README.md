 I have derived a formula for calculating the required number of photons to create a black hole from photons
Introduction:
The creation of a black hole from photons represents a hypothetical task of interest within the context of relativity and quantum mechanics. Various mechanisms for black hole formation exist, including the merging of massive objects, but the question of forming a black hole from photons requires further exploration. This paper presents the derivation of a formula to calculate the minimum number of photons needed to form a black hole, based on energy and mass balance principles.

Theoretical Basis:
From the Schwarzschild formula for the event horizon radius of a black hole without angular momentum, we have:
𝑅
𝑠
=
2
𝐺
𝑀
𝑐

R 
s
​
 = 
c

2GM
​
 
Rearranging for mass, we get:
𝑀
=
𝑅
𝑠
𝑐

𝐺
M= 
2G
R

​
 c

​
 
For a Schwarzschild black hole, Einstein's famous formula is applicable. Substituting the expression for mass in terms of the Schwarzschild radius, we obtain:
𝐸
=
𝑅
𝑠
𝑐

𝐺
E=

This expression allows us to compute the rest energy of a Schwarzschild black hole.

The energy of a photon is expressed in terms of its frequency:
𝐸
=
ℎ
𝑐
𝜆
E= 
λ
hc
​
 
where 
ℎ
h is Planck's constant and 
𝜆
λ is the wavelength of the photon.

To determine the number of photons 
𝐽
J required to form a black hole, we divide the energy of the black hole by the energy of a single photon:
𝐽
=
𝐸
black hole
𝐸

J= 
E

​
 
E

Substituting the expressions for energy, we get:
𝐽

𝐺

J=

R

After simplifying, the final formula for the number of photons is:
𝐽

Discussion:
The proposed formula provides an intriguing result that theoretically allows for the estimation of the minimum number of photons required to form a black hole. However, it is important to note that this is a hypothetical assumption, which faces several challenges in reality, such as the impossibility of such a concentrated photon accumulation and the requirements related to quantum effects, which are not accounted for in this model.

Conclusion:
In this paper, a formula was derived to calculate the number of photons necessary to create a black hole. Although the task is hypothetical, the result offers a fascinating theoretical insight into the intersection of quantum mechanics and relativity.
