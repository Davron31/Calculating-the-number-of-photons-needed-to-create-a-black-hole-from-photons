# Creating a Black Hole from Photons: A Theoretical Approach

## Theoretical Basis

From the Schwarzschild formula for the event horizon radius of a black hole without angular momentum, we have:

$$ R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$

Rearranging for mass, we get:

$$ M = \frac{R_s c^2}{2G} $$

For a Schwarzschild black hole, Einstein's famous formula \(E = mc^2\) is applicable. Substituting the expression for mass in terms of the Schwarzschild radius, we obtain:

$$ E = \frac{R_s c^4}{2G} $$
