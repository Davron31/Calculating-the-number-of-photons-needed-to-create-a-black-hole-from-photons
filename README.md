# Creating a Black Hole from Photons: A Theoretical Approach  

## Introduction  
The creation of a black hole from photons represents a hypothetical task of interest within the context of relativity and quantum mechanics. Various mechanisms for black hole formation exist, including the merging of massive objects, but the question of forming a black hole from photons requires further exploration. This document presents the derivation of a formula to calculate the minimum number of photons needed to form a black hole, based on energy and mass balance principles.  

## Theoretical Basis  

From the Schwarzschild formula for the event horizon radius of a black hole without angular momentum, we have:  

\[
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]  

Rearranging for mass, we get:  

\[
M = \frac{R_s c^2}{2G}
\]  

For a Schwarzschild black hole, Einstein's famous formula \(E = mc^2\) is applicable. Substituting the expression for mass in terms of the Schwarzschild radius, we obtain:  

\[
E = \frac{R_s c^4}{2G}
\]  

This expression allows us to compute the rest energy of a Schwarzschild black hole.  

The energy of a photon is expressed in terms of its wavelength:  

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]  

where:  
- \(h\) is Planck's constant,  
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the photon.  

To determine the number of photons \(J\) required to form a black hole, we divide the energy of the black hole by the energy of a single photon:  

\[
J = \frac{E_\text{black hole}}{E_\text{photon}}
\]  

Substituting the expressions for energy, we get:  

\[
J = \frac{R_s c^4 \lambda}{2Ghc}
\]  

After simplifying, the final formula for the number of photons is:  

\[
J = \frac{R_s c^3 \lambda}{2Gh}
\]  

## Discussion  

The proposed formula provides an intriguing result that theoretically allows for the estimation of the minimum number of photons required to form a black hole. However, it is important to note that this is a hypothetical assumption, which faces several challenges in reality, such as:  
- The impossibility of such a concentrated photon accumulation.  
- Quantum effects that are not accounted for in this model.  

## Conclusion  

In this document, a formula was derived to calculate the number of photons necessary to create a black hole. Although the task is hypothetical, the result offers a fascinating theoretical insight into the intersection of quantum mechanics and relativity.
